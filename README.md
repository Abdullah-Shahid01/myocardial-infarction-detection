# 🫀 Heart Failure Clinical Data Analysis

This project explores the **Heart Failure Clinical Records Dataset** from Kaggle to analyze and visualize key patterns, build predictive models, and understand the contributing factors of heart failure. The aim is to demonstrate data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning workflows in a clear and reproducible way using Python.

📊 **Dataset Source:**  
[Kaggle – Heart Failure Clinical Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data)

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `code.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the full workflow — from data loading and preprocessing to model building and evaluation.
- `README.md`: Project documentation (you’re here).
- `data.csv`: CSV file containing the data (downloaded from Kaggle).

## 🧠 Objectives

- Load and preprocess clinical records of heart failure patients.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and correlations.
- Apply classification models to predict the likelihood of death due to heart failure.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics.

## 📈 Results & Insights

- Identified key predictors of heart failure, such as **serum creatinine**, **ejection fraction**, and **time**.
- Best performing models showed promising accuracy for a small medical dataset.
- Visual insights suggest patients with lower ejection fraction and high serum creatinine had a higher mortality risk.
